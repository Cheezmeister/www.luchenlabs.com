Ah, the dreaded remote live coding interview,
A virtual arena where nerves and screens collide.
As I sit here, staring at a blank code pad,
My mind racing, my fingers poised to type.

But alas, the connection lags, the video freezes,
My thoughts interrupted, my flow disrupted.
I try to explain my logic, my process,
But the words stumble out, disjointed and jumbled.

Oh, how I long for a better way,
To showcase my skills, my true capabilities.
Perhaps a take-home project, where I can work at my pace,
Or a pair programming session, where collaboration thrives.

Let's embrace asynchronous communication,
And provide candidates the time and space they need.
Forcing them to perform under pressure,
Only reveals a fraction of what they can achieve.
